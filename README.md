# Undervalued or Overpriced? A Predictive Model of Calgary Property Assessments
# Property Value Prediction Using Linear Regression (R)

## Overview
This project was completed as part of *Statistical Modeling with Data* at the University of Calgary as part of the Data Science professional masters program.  
The objective was to build and evaluate a supervised machine learning model to predict the assessed value of residential properties based on their characteristics.

## Data
Property assessment data was obtained from the City of Calgary Open Data Portal and used as training data.  
The dataset includes features such as property type, lot size, location, and age of building.

## Methodology
- Implemented a **supervised learning regression model (linear regression)** in R
- Performed data cleaning and feature selection
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate regression metrics
- Interpreted model coefficients to assess feature influence on property value

## Results
The final model demonstrates how property characteristics contribute to assessed value and serves as an interpretable baseline for real estate valuation tasks.
