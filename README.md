# Undervalued or Overpriced? A Predictive Model of Calgary Property Assessments
# Property Value Prediction Using Linear Regression (R)

## Overview
This project was completed as part of *Statistical Modeling with Data* at the University of Calgary as part of the Data Science professional masters program.  
The objective was to build and evaluate a supervised machine learning model to predict the assessed value of residential properties based on their characteristics.

## Data
Passenger data was obtained from the Data Science Dojo github repository.
The dataset includes features such name, gender, ticket class, family members, and cabin.

## Methodology
- Implemented **supervised learning models (decision tree and random forest)** in Python
- Performed data cleaning and model fitting
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and visualization
- Interpreted model to assess feature influence on survivability

## Results
The final model demonstrates how individual characteristics of passengers contribute to their survivability.
